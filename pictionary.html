Guess. Win</b></small></div><p class="nc-card-body nc-ff-o">Pictionary is a board game where a player from each team take turns drawing a word on a card that they pull. Their team members need to guess this word with no other hints other than draw-ings. You just need to be creative and draw the right things at the right moment to win this game.<br><br><b>Rules</b><br>1. Each team will consist of 2 players. One player will draw clue. The chosen person to draw has only ten seconds to look at the card and plan his drawing strategy. Another player from the same team is now trying to guess the drawn clue.<br>2. The two- minute timer starts and the person drawing for the team begins drawing on board without using any verbal communication or gestures.<br>3. Writing numbers or letters on your paper is against the rules.<br>4. If this is accomplished in less than two- minute, they can advance themselves and new card (clue) is drawn.<br>5. The same team that is drawing is now trying to guess the drawn clue. Rotating drawing team members (the person drawing the clue) is part of the rules.<br>6 The team to guess the highest number of correct clue is then named the winner of the game.<br><br><b>Where will it happen?</b><br>Open Space</p><a class="nc-arrow-anchor-back nc-more nc-icon-button" href="index.html"><img class="nc-arrow" src="./icons/back.svg" alt="back" nc-svg></a><div class="nc-margin-small"><img class="nc-icon nc-float-right" src="./icons/leaf.svg" alt="peace" width="4%" nc-svg></div></div><script src="build.js"></script></body></html>
